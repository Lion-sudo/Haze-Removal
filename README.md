# Haze Removal Project

## üåç Introduction

This project implements haze removal techniques based on **Dark Channel Prior** and **Color Attenuation Prior**, using **Guided Filtering** or **Weighted Guided Filtering**.
The goal is to restore contrast and detail, making hazy images clearer and more visually accurate.

The project is designed to be flexible and easily extendable, using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## ‚ú® Features
- This project supports **four** haze removal techniques:
  - **Dark Channel Prior** using **Guided Filtering**
  - **Dark Channel Prior** using **Weighted Guided Filtering**
  - **Color Attenuation Prior** using **Guided Filtering**
  - **Color Attenuation Prior** using **Weighted Guided Filtering**
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface** ‚Äî Dynamically select the image path and haze removal technique.

## üîß Installation

### Requirements

Ensure you have **Python 3.10** or newer installed, then clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lion-sudo/Haze-Removal.git

# Change the directory 
cd Haze-Removal

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The required libraries are:

- `opencv-python~=4.11.0.86`
- `numpy~=2.2.2`

---

## ‚ö° Usage

Run the program with:

```bash
python haze_removal.py
```

### Step 1: Provide an image path

Once the program starts, you'll be prompted to enter the **path to the image** you wish to process:

```bash
Please provide the path to the image you would like to use:
```

### Step 2: Choose a haze removal technique

After loading the image, select a haze removal method from the list:

```yaml
Choose the haze removal method:
1: Dark Channel Prior using Guided Filter 
2: Dark Channel Prior using Weighted Guided Filter 
3: Color Attenuation Prior using Guided Filter
4: Color Attenuation Prior using Weighted Guided Filter
5: Exit the program
```

### Step 3: Continue or exit

After processing, you'll be asked whether you want to continue or exit the program:

```yaml
Would you like to continue or exit?
1: Continue using the current image
2: Load a new image
3: Exit the program
```

- If you choose **1**, you'll go back to Step 2 using the same image.
- If you choose **2**, you'll return to Step 1 to provide a new image path.
- If you choose **3**, the program will exit.

The program keeps running until you choose to exit.

### Output Image Naming Convention

The processed images will be saved in the project directory using the following naming format:  
`{input_name}_haze_free_{method_name}.jpg`

- `{input_name}` refers to the name of the input image chosen by the user.
- `{method_name}` indicates the haze removal technique chosen by the user.

For example:
- `new_york3_haze_free_CAP_Guided_Method.jpg` is the output of the image selected by the user ("new_york3.jpg"), processed using **Color Attenuation Prior** with **Guided Filtering**.

You can continue experimenting with different techniques or process multiple images before exiting.
